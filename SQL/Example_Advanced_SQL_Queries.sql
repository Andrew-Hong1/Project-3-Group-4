--Find Countries with Active Volcanoes and High HDI:
-- This SQL query retrieves data about countries with active volcanoes and a high Human Development Index (HDI). It calculates the total count of active 
-- volcanoes for each country, filters for countries with an HDI greater than or equal to 0.8, and then presents the results sorted by the total count of active 
-- volcanoes in descending order.

WHERE v.H_active = 1 AND h.HDI >= 0.8
GROUP BY v.Country, h.HDI
ORDER BY Total_Active_Volcanoes DESC;

--Find Most Common VEI Classification:
-- This SQL query retrieves data about volcanic eruptions and their VEI classifications. It calculates the count of eruptions for each VEI classification, 
-- sorts them in descending order by the count, and then limits the result to the VEI classification with the highest count of eruptions.

--List Volcanoes with the Highest Risk Level:
-- this SQL query retrieves data about volcanoes, their risk levels, associated countries, and HDI values. It filters out rows with missing or "None" values 
-- in the risk column and then orders the result set first by risk level and then by HDI in descending order.

--Find Countries with Active Volcanoes and Low HDI:
--This query retrieves data about countries with active volcanoes and a low Human Development Index (HDI) below 0.6.
--It calculates the total count of active volcanoes for each country and presents the results sorted by the total count of active volcanoes in descending order.

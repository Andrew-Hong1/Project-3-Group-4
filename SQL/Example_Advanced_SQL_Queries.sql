--Calculate Average VEI for Active Volcanoes:
-- this SQL query retrieves data about active volcanoes, their VEI values, and the associated countries. It calculates the average VEI value for each country, 
-- filters for active volcanoes, and presents the results sorted by the average VEI values in descending order. This helps identify countries with the highest 
-- average VEI values.

WHERE v.H_active = 1

-- List Countries with the Highest PEI per Active Volcano:
-- This SQL query retrieves data related to active volcanoes and their population exposure indices (PEI) from two tables, groups the data by country, 
-- filters out countries with no active volcanoes, and then orders the results by the calculated PEI per active volcano in descending order, showing countries with 
-- the highest PEI per active volcano at the top of the result set.

--Find Countries with Active Volcanoes and High HDI:
-- This SQL query retrieves data about countries with active volcanoes and a high Human Development Index (HDI). It calculates the total count of active 
-- volcanoes for each country, filters for countries with an HDI greater than or equal to 0.8, and then presents the results sorted by the total count of active 
-- volcanoes in descending order.

--Find Most Common VEI Classification:
-- This SQL query retrieves data about volcanic eruptions and their VEI classifications. It calculates the count of eruptions for each VEI classification, 
-- sorts them in descending order by the count, and then limits the result to the VEI classification with the highest count of eruptions.

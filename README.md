U-NHHR/U-HHR Definition: 
Table 1 Identity of Italy’s volcanoes in each Hazard-PEI group. Those volcanoes with a sufficient record for determining a hazard score are deemed ‘classified’ (top). Those without sufficient data are ‘Unclassified’ (bottom). The unclassified volcanoes are divided into groups: U-NHHR is Unclassified No Historic or Holocene Record: that is there are no confirmed eruptions recorded in the Holocene. UHR is Unclassified with Holocene Record: that is there are confirmed eruptions recorded during the Holocene, but no historical (post-1500) events. U-HHR is Unclassified with Historic and Holocene record. The unclassified volcanoes in bold have experienced unrest or eruptions since 1900 AD, and those in red have records of at least one Holocene VEI ≥4 eruption.

Holocene Definition:
The Holocene is the current geological epoch. It began approximately 9,700 years before the Common Era (BCE).

Hazard Definition:
A long-term volcano hazard assessment report is a publication that summarizes the types and likelihood of future hazardous phenomena expected to occur at a specific volcano or volcanic region. The report typically includes a summary of the specific hazards, their impact areas, and a map showing ground-hazard zones. The assessments are also critical for planning long-term land-use, and effective emergency-response measures, especially when a volcano begins to show signs of unrest.
